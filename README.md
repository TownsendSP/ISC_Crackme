# ISC_Crackme
Crackme written for a reverse engineering workshop for the [Syracuse University Information Security Club](https://studentorgs.syr.edu/isc/).
Built with Qt6 on Linux, Qt5 on MacOS and Windows. 
To keep the disassembly as similar as possible between the platforms, there are only static builds for x64 MacOS, so Rosetta is required to run the program on MacOS
